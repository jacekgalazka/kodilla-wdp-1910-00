/* EFFECT
The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:

ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end (pre-selected)
ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
